Brought into our London centre, Roseanne preferred her own company, keeping to the back of her pen, and avoiding physical contact. Staff could see that life in a busy domestic home would not suit her independent streak and so we searched for exactly the right match for her – a rural outlet where she could roam to her heart’s content. Roseanne is now living on a farm in Hampshire next to a 500-acre wood and her new owners tell us she is happy and healthy, living her life as she wants to as more of a wild cat rather than a family pet.">

He normally sleeps in a comfy armchair full of pillows in our bedroom, but recently he has spent more and more time at the bottom of our bed - we're wondering whether he will actually take over one day! He is starting to go outside in the garden, and it looks like he feels like a natural predator again! Thank you for looking after James and introducing him to us, we're all very happy.">

We have let him freely roam all the corridors, bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom as he was desperate to investigate and have more space - he has been burning off energy continually! The lovely thing is that he just seems to want to be near us all the time, whatever room we are in. We thank you so much for all your hard work and dedication in caring for him during his time at Battersea.">

He loves running around outside all day, and during the evening he enjoys nothing more than curling up on my lap or in his bed. His favourite game is to chase the laser pointer around the house - this provides hours of fun for both Finley and us.">

He has found his new favourite spot stretched out on his Battersea blanket on the sofa. We've introduced him to the rest of the house now, which means a lovely morning wake-up call of a cat flopping down on your head.">

However, that was certainly not the case. It took him just a few hours to explore our entire house and make his mark. There was no doubt that he felt this was his new home instantly. Lenny is the perfect cat for us and we are so grateful to have found him.">

Although the staff there knew that we only wanted one cat, they decided to introduce us to sisters called Abigail and Amelia or as I like to call them, Trouble 1 and Trouble 2. When we went in to a side room to decide, it was unanimous. The sisters had stolen our hearts. Abigail is bold and curious while Amelia is shy and sedate although they both love to play. They have brought a new dimension to our lives and we simply love them to bits.">

He loves running around the house and playing chase. Rudi is the perfect match for us. He’s smart, cheeky, very affectionate and has definitely made such huge impact on our lives with his funny quirks. It’s lovely to have him waiting for us when we come home after work.">

He gradually grew in confidence and progressed from hiding under the bed to being a real lap cat. He's now an affectionate and chatty boy who always lets us know when he thinks it's dinner time, or if he feels like he hasn't been the centre of attention quite enough!">

We do chuckle as they chase each other around the house, and at how Star chats with Bob when he's come in from one of his longer roams. Star is definitely the more homely cat and loves staying near to home. They have explored the neighbourhood and love nothing more than sitting on the roof of our bathroom extension, gazing back in at us. This pair have transformed our lives and we are happier than we could ever have imagined - Bob and Star have made our house a home!">

He loves his food and is obsessed with sweet wrappers and a pink sparkly cat toy. He loves running round the garden and gets on very well with our two other cats and the two Bengals who live next door.">

We’ve started trying to get him to play although we were all stunned when he rejected the opportunity to investigate an empty box! No doubt he’ll get even more brave in time.">

At first Rosie was a bit nervous and caused us some anxious moments when she did her disappearing tricks, hiding in tiny spaces we didn't even know about, such as in the cloakroom wall and behind the dishwasher. But she soon started to find her feet and now she treats us all to her lovely purr and affectionate rubs around our legs. For a fairly small cat, she has a vociferous appetite and will not hesitate to meow for her breakfast and various snacks. We all adore Rosie and, to us, no cat could match her.">

Following my leaving Battersea, I seem to have landed on my paws (well I am a cat!). I have got used to my new house and the rooms upstairs and down. I have explored the garden, which is new to me as I have previously lived in a flat. Another new thing is my personal entrance/exit in the kitchen door, this is great as I can come as go when I please even when my human is out at work. I will probably be staying inside more during the winter but did enjoy the late summer sunshine while it lasted. ">

She had a reputation as a less than friendly cat, but that couldn't be further from the truth now. She wakes us up every morning with chirps, and is happiest sitting on a nice warm lap. Thank you so much for introducing her to our house, and for giving me the best chance at giving her the happy home she deserves. I can't believe how brilliant this kitty is, and how happy she makes me when I come home. I wanted you to know that she really has found her happy ending.">

She is very loving, and definitely has a playful side as well. After darting to a hiding place, the cupboard under the stairs, where she hid for a few hours, she was out for a reccy of the flat. A few circuits done and she came looking for cuddles. Loulabelle is particularly fond of her cardboard box with a cushion in the bottom. Her favourite toys are the little plastic balls with bells in (making for a welcome fluffy morning alarm clock), and the feather stick has really brought out her hunting instincts. I am in awe of how smoothly everything has gone.">

We've been trying to spend any work or relaxation time we have at home with him, which has helped him accept and trust us. Although he often looks at us quite suspiciously when we enter the room, Jasper is very fond of cuddles and regularly comes up to demand our attention. As for the rest of the house, he is still exploring. Jasper is definitely becoming braver the more time he spends with us.">
