Bud loves being involved in whatever the family is doing and we’ve all fallen in love with him. He’s enjoying daily walks and long snoozes in the lounge; he’s got several dog friends, and has even befriended a pet rabbit.">

His owner had tried several other rescue centres who wouldn’t take him in. Winston had hereditary breathing problems including wheezing and being unable to walk far without becoming breathless. Our Vets operated on his brachycephalic condition to open up his airways, a complex procedure that they are increasingly having to perform as demand for flat-faced breeds such as Bulldogs, French Bulldogs and Pugs increases. A fully-recovered Winston met The Duchess of Cornwall when she visited the Home to officially open Battersea’s new Veterinary Hospital and Centre of Excellence, and he now lives happily with his new owner in Kent.">

When he was brought into Battersea, our veterinary team were shocked by his skinny, hairless body. After spending a month with Battersea’s vets and vet nurses, Ralph was placed in temporary foster care. His foster mum Wendy fell head over heels for this very special dog and went on to keep him!" data-id="0">

She is loving, feisty, obedient (well sometimes!) and is very, very special. Poppy is an expert swimmer, we were so shocked she took to the water like a fish. She adores the beach and loves sunbathing, she has a swimming vest and rope to keep her safe and a wet scarf that we put on her so she doesn't get sunstroke. We send our love and thanks to you all for letting us rehome our little star.">

His favourite things are sleeping in the sun and nosing out of the window. Everyone loves him. He's also loving his time with his dog walker and doggie chums! Thanks so much Battersea for doing such a great job matching us to Archie.">

She was the kindest, most gentlest dog we have ever known and when our daughter Layla was born in 2005, Judy protected her and watched over her and they became the best of friends. We feel blessed to have had Judy in our lives, she was a huge part of our family. She was not just our pet, she was our best friend, our &quot;special girl&quot; and was loved by all who knew her.

We looked at a few who needed help for various reasons but one who was struggling emotionally with the noise and kennel environment appeared to be the most needy. Day one and we were smitten. She was quite literally an angel. We feel honored to have had such a wonderful little being with us for five love filled years. Very much missed but so grateful for everything she gave us.

I viewed Saskia online and fell in love with her, I didn&#039;t have reservations about having an older dog; in fact I think they can live longer when they get a chance at a new lease of life. She was we were told  a big hit with the staff at Battersea, a difficult dog to walk as Bassets can be but a real character and she certainly didn&#039;t disappoint, she made us laugh every day! Sandy as we renamed her was a very sociable dog and liked to be around dogs all the time. We made sure we gave her the best five years of her life and I don&#039;t think we could ever have loved a dog as much as Sandy. She made it to the grand old age of 13! Not bad for a Basset! I wanted you all to know how much we loved her and made sure she had the best life.">
